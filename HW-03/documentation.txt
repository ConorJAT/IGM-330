Coding Language / Bundling:

For the coding aspect of this project, I decided to utilize Typescript.


Code Changes Implemented:

Using Typescript, I implemented several notable changes. First, I moved both my sprite class
and any newly created interfaces into their own individual folders and imported them where
necessary. Regarding the new interfaces, I converted my drawing parameters, in addition to any
visualizer default values into separate interfaces in order to not have to worry about managing
them in the primary Typescript files. Lastly, I spent some time strongly typing many of my variables
(especially my HTML elements) in order to accustom to the Typescript format.
